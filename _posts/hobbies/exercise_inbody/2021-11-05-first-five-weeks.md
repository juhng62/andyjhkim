This post is a record of the first five weeks at a gym.

## Why I Started to Exercise
In fact, I am not a gym person. Not even close to exercise at all. Even when I was in school, I rather read a book alone while others playing football outside. But throught the pandemic, I had to take university courses which were held in Toronto time in South Korea for 1 year and 8 months. It really hurt me. I studied when everyone slept and I slept when everyone was up. Literally I wasn't exposed to sunlight. I was more or less a zombie.

## Purpose of Exercise
1. I truly realized the importance of fitness. During the time that my day and night were all mixed up, my health was broken. First my physical health was out of order and then my mental health was collapsed subsequently. That was terrible experience.  
2. As my mental health was at danger, the level of self-esteem was pretty low. I wanted to do something which can recover my self-esteem, i.e., something I can see successful results and something good for my life. That something was exercise in conclusion.

## General Review
Achieved the first goal: loss 1kg per a week. In addition, I reduced 2kg of body fat mass. Imagine 2L of water of milk. I got rid of that amount of fat. Everyone said I got noticeably slim. But I'm not sure I can continue to loss weight at this pace. I am now more interested in building muscle.
