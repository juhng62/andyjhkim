### What I did:

1. Confirmed what to do for next.

2. Wrote sample config.json and survey.tsv

### What to do:

1. Ask Vanessasaurus

    - Where am I supposed to contribute surveys?

      https://github.com/expfactory/expfactory-experiments

      or https://github.com/expfactory-experiments

      or https://github.com/expfactory/expfactory-surveys

      If the first one, how do I do PR?

    - Anything else to do apart from config.json and survey.tsv?

    - config.json format different. Which one to follow?

      https://github.com/expfactory/expfactory-surveys/blob/master/bis11_survey/config.json

      or https://expfactory.github.io/contribute

      For the second one, how do I write url before my pull request is accepted?

2. Check option values are actually revised in survey.tsv.

3. Write description and instruction if I have to.
